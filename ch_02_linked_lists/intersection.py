PROBLEM

Intersection: 
* Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. 
* Return the interÂ­secting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. 
* That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the 
	jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.

Notes:
* A linked-list node cannot point totwo different nodes as its next node
* If they ever intersect, they need to have their last node as the exact same node 

* Time Complexity: O(N), ~O(2*N), where N grows with input size
* Space Complexity: O(1), no additional space required
